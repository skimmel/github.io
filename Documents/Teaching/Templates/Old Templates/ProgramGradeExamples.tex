{\huge How Programming Assignments Affect Your Grade}

\begin{itemize}
\item You have at most an A- and you have not done any programming assignments, or you do a programming assignment but it does not meet specifications $\rightarrow$ final grade will remain unchanged.
\item You have an A- or A in the course, and you do both programming assignments to specification $\rightarrow$ final grade will be A.
\item You have an A or A- in the course, but you do not complete both programming assignments to specification $\rightarrow$ final grade will be A-.
\item You have a high B in the course, and you complete one programming assignment to specification $\rightarrow$ final grade will be B+. (One assignment gives you a boost of half a step in letter grade.)
\item You have a low B in the course, and you complete one programming assignment to specification $\rightarrow$ final grade will be B. (One assignment gives you a boost of half a step in letter grade.)
\item You have a low B in the course, and you complete both programming assignments to specification $\rightarrow$ final grade will be B+. (Two assignments give you a boost of a step in letter grade.)
