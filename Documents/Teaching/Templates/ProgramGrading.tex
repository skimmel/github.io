{\huge Grading Rubric for Programming Problems}
\end{center}
\bigskip

Programming assignments will be graded based on a 30-point rubric (see next page). On this page, we give a little more information about the categories in the rubric:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Program Specifications:} You program should work correctly on all inputs. Also, if there any specifications about how the program should be written, or how the output should appear, those specifications should be followed.

\item \textbf{Readability:} Variables and functions should have meaningful names. Code should be organized into functions/methods where appropriate. There should be an appropriate amount of white space so that the code is readable, and indentation should be consistent.

\item \textbf{Documentation} Your code and functions/methods should be appropriately commented. However, not every line should be commented because that makes your code overly busy. Think carefully about where comments are needed. 

\item \textbf{Code Efficiency} There are many ways to write the same functionality into your code, and some of them are needlessly slow or complicated. For example, if you are repeating the same code, it should be inside  creating a new method/function or for loop.

\item \textbf{Assignment Specifications} The assignment will likely ask you to include certain information as comments, or save your program with a certain file name, or other such specifications. These tasks fall under ``assignment specifications.''
\end{itemize}
