Please write a paragraph or two reflecting on the learning process while both working on and grading this problem set. Be as specific as possible. Here are some questions to get you thinking, but please write about what feels relevant to your experience. What skills did the problem set help you to improve? Are there skills related to the problem set where you still need more practice? What concepts do you now understand, or don't yet understand? Do you notice any improvements from prior problem sets? What questions do you have about the material or problems? (Literally, ask me a question!) Did you notice any misconceptions or repeated mistakes? What approaches did you try that did work/did not work? What emotions did the problem set evoke (for example pride, frustration, confidence, confusion) and why? What is your plan of practice to prepare for the quiz, and why? (Literally, which specific problems from which textbooks will you attempt to answer?)}
