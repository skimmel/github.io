\noindent{\Large {Reflection Worksheet}}

(This worksheet is a suggested guide. You can responsed on another piece of paper, as long as you include the required responses.)

\bigskip
For each problem in the problem set, record your points, and write at least one sentence explaining why you think this problem was assigned. For example, is there a skill that the problem is helping you to practice? Or is there an aspect of a topic that the problem helps you to understand more fully? Or does this problem help you to achieve the course learning goals?

Please write a paragraph reflecting on the learning process while both working on and grading this problem set. For example, what skills did the problem set help you to improve? are there are skills related to the problem set where you still need more practice? what concepts do you now understand, or don't yet understand? did you realize any misconceptions or repeated mistakes? what emotions did the problem set evoke (for example pride, frustration, confidence, confusion) and why?
