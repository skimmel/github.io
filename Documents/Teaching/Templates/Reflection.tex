\noindent{\Huge {Reflection Worksheet  }}%\hfill Problem Set: $\rule{3cm}{.15mm}$




\vspace{1cm}
Please write two paragraphs: one for a personal reflection and one for a group reflection. You do not need to answer exactly these questions, but your reflection should address similar themes.

\paragraph{Personal Learning Reflection Prompt:}
What skills did the problem set help you to improve? Are there skills related to the problem set where you still need more practice? What concepts do you now understand, or don't yet understand? Do you notice any improvements from prior problem sets? What questions do you have about the material or problems? (Literally, ask me a question!) Did you notice any misconceptions or repeated mistakes? Was the feedback from the feedback TA (from the prior week) helpful? What approaches did you try that did work/did not work? What emotions did the problem set evoke (for example pride, frustration, confidence, confusion) and why? What is your plan of practice to prepare for the quiz, and why?

\paragraph{Group Work Reflection Prompt} What did you do in group work this week to actively engage each member of your group? What could you have done to better engage with each member and to make sure each member had the space to contribute? What do you plan to do in the future to make group work a more productive experience for each person in your group? Was there anything you found particularly valuable or frustrating about group work this week?
